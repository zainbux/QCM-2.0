# Client Website
This is a website created for a client located in the Ottawa-Gatineau area. The website utilizes Sanity.io for the backend and Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS for the frontend.

## Description
The website takes advantage of the new Next.js 13 server components to fetch data from the backend and display it using React. It offers various sections, including an About section, a carousel of images showcasing the client's work, a pricing schema for customers, and a booking section.

The booking section provides a range of options for customers to choose from for their detailing package. It also includes a form for customers to enter their information and book a service. All the data on the website is dynamic and can be easily updated via Sanity-Studio accessible through the "/admin" route. This flexibility was a key requirement for the client, enabling them to effortlessly update the photo carousel and adjust prices based on current demands.
